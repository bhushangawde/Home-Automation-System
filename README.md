# Home-Automation-System

This project We used Arduino Uno hardware board for the project.
Temperature and Humidity sensors were used for getting the respective values from the surrounding in real time. They were attached at the input pin of microcontroller ATMega328 present on the Arduino Uno board.
Esp8266 Wi-Fi module was connected to the board and was used for uploading the values of temperature and pressure to the server.
LED and motor were attached to the output of the microcontroller attached on the board 
A website was made which has a button to control the LED and motor attached at the output of Arduino microcontroller on the basis of these temperature and humidity values of the surroundings.
